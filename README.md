## Evaluating Point of Interest (POI) Data from Different Sources to Support Geographic Data-Based Decision Making

**Supervisor:** Sándor Juhász

**Short description:**
This thesis examines the differences between Points of Interest (POI) datasets from OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, and Foursquare. These platforms vary in their data collection methods, coverage, and update frequencies. The thesis will compare their data attributes and evaluate their real-world accuracy through case studies of selected streets, parks, and neighborhoods.

**Research questions/Tasks/Topics:** <br>
* How do POI datasets from OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, and Foursquare differ in terms of coverage, accuracy, and attribute richness?<br>
* What are the strengths and limitations of each dataset for different types of locations (e.g., streets, parks, neighborhoods)?<br>
* How does the choice of POI dataset impact urban analysis and decision-making?
